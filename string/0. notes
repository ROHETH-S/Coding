we cant simply a convert a string to lower by "to_lower" we must loop and change each charachter

we cant push back a string in "push_back" we can only do for char
string s1="";
s1=s1+word1[i];

we cant concanetate to char, only string be

in the string we cant simply use the digt present in the string as int, we must do this 
index=s[i]-'1';
