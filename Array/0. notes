segmentation fault occurse if there is no return value or return value is of other type

run time error happens, when size is not declared properly 
 vector<int> ans(max_num+1, 0); do like this


for reversing the digit, it is better to convdert as string and do reverse operation
number can be converted to string by "to_string()"
and string can be converted  to int by "stoi()" or by subtracting (str[i] - '0')
